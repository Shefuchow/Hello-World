First project - Hello World
/**
I am a Student going into my freshmen year at University at Buffalo
My decided major is currently Mechanical Engineering, but I am
thinking about swtiching to Computer Engineering or Computer Science.
This decision is after aquiring and completeing two different internships
in two different engineering firms. The first in the School Construction
Authority as an intern in the Electrical Engineering department and second
at the world renown engineering firm Skanska as a Mechanical engineering intern.
